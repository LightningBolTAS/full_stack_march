# My First HTML & CSS Project

This repository contains my first attempt at building a webpage using HTML and CSS.

## Description

This project is a simple webpage designed to practice basic HTML structure and CSS styling. It includes:

* Basic HTML elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.).
* Simple CSS styling for layout, colors, and fonts.
* Demonstrates understanding of fundamental web development concepts.

## Files

* `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
* `style.css`: The CSS file containing the styling rules for the webpage.

## How to View

1.  Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).

## Learning Points

* This project helped me understand the basic structure of HTML documents.
* I learned how to apply CSS styles to HTML elements.
* I gained experience with basic CSS properties like `color`, `font-size`, and `margin`.
* This is a beginner project, and I am still learning.

## Future Improvements

* I plan to add more interactive elements using JavaScript.
* I want to improve the layout and design to make it more visually appealing.
* I will work on making the page responsive.
* I will add more complex CSS styling.
